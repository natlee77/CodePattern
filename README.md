    The kennel.
The task:
You have been commissioned to create a program for a kennel. The requirements of the program are as follows:

The program should be able to
Register new customers
Register new animals
See which customers are registered
See which animals are registered
See which animals belong to which customers
Report that an animal has been submitted
Report that an animal has been retrieved
See which animals are currently submitted and which customers these belong to
Link extra services to an animal
Laundry
Claw clipping
When an animal is picked up, a receipt must be shown with the cost of the day and any extra services.
Other functionality that you think is relevant
Think about how the requirements for the program could change in the future and how in such cases you could expand the program WITHOUT having to change existing code.
